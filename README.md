# Checkers-2D
Feel free to use it as your college/university project while it is public.
The project was created in Unity 6. After building and running, a window will be created that contains:
- board with 24 checkers;
- button to offer a draw;
- button for losing;
- button to turn on/off the sound;
- button to enable/disable the board rotation animation.
